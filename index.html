        About Me


My Journey

I started loving nail art when I was little. I was inspired by my mom’s pretty, painted nails. After high school, I took nail classes to learn more. Now, I enjoy creating nail art for people every day.

More About Me

I also love to travel and try new foods. Seeing new places and tasting different cuisines gives me new ideas for my nail designs.

I believe that nail art is fun and a way to show your style. I hope you enjoy my work as much as I love creating it!
